# Dream Woollies

Dream Woollies e-commerce is a site created as the 4th and last Milestone Project inside Code Institute fullstack developer course. The main purpose of this site is to present and sell wet and needle felted toys and durable accessories made from fine merino wool. All the products are handmade, unique and created from natural materials by a friend of mine.

The app functionality was made using Django3 framework to encourage rapid development. VScode was my choice of code editor. During development, I used sqlite as a database and after deployment on Heroku, I switched to Postgres to ensure that any data entered was visible in my deployed application.

The deployed link for the site is: <https://dream-woollies-ms4.herokuapp.com/>

When testing this app, to make a payment, the following details should be used:

* Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
* CVC: any three numbers
* Date: any future date
* ZIP Code: any five numbers
